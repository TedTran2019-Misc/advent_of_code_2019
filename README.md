Casually participating for fun! 

Lost on day 14 part 2, ended up looking at vinc's solution https://github.com/vinc/adventofcode/blob/master/ruby/2019/14/lib.rb
  - Can't believe I lost on this problem, though. Part 1 was extremely easy, then for some reason, I couldn't get part 2 for the life of me. Ended up coming up with my own solution, but whatever. Valuable lessons from this are
   1. Cleanly abstract code for easier understanding
   2. Take breaks, rubberduck, and understand the problem rather than just mindlessly tackling it. It's better to take thirty minutes to think rather than spend a few hours wandering aimlessly. Actively think, understand, and experiment instead of being mindless. It's embarassing to have been stumped and given up on such an easy problem in hindsight. 
   - All that needed to be understood on this problem is what needs to happen logically on each recursive step. 

I'm still going to participate, but focus more on refactoring my old code using Rubocop and looking at more experienced developers' solutions as guidance/inspiration upon completing a problem.
