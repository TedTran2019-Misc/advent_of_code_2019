# advent_of_code_2019
Casually participating for fun! 

Lost on day 14 part 2, ended up looking at vinc's solution https://github.com/vinc/adventofcode/blob/master/ruby/2019/14/lib.rb

I'm still going to participate, but focus more on refactoring my old code using Rubocop and looking at more experienced developers' solutions as guidance/inspiration upon completing a problem.
