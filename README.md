# advent_of_code_2019
Casually participating for fun! 

Lost on day 14 part 2, ended up looking at vinc's solution https://github.com/vinc/adventofcode/blob/master/ruby/2019/14/lib.rb

I'm going to still participate, but refactor my old code using Rubocop and looking at more experienced developers' solutions as guidance.
